Software Engineer, Tech Lead - Currently working at [Kingspan Isoeste](https://kingspan-isoeste.com.br).

I've been Full Stack ðŸ’» since 2016, where I started my journey with Laravel Framework projects written in PHP for Server Side and HTML, CSS and JavaScript as Client Side. Then I went through Java 8 and Spring Boot architecture, providing REST APIs for Angular 2+ applications to consume.

I have a passion for development, innovation, technology, and I strive to learn something new every day.

Have a nice day =)
